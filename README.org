* js-comint (version 0.0.2)
It's only a bug fix version of [[http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/][js-cominit 0.0.1]].

Since it's not been updated for about five years. There is some compatibility issue with latest node.js.

That's what I will fix. I intend to keep it in maintaining mode and avoid adding any new command.

* Features added by me
- Use node.js by default.
- when loading file, detect what API to be used automatically

* Set up
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(require 'js-comint)
;; if use node.js, we need nice output
(setenv "NODE_NO_READLINE" "1")
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Check it's [[http://js-comint-el.sourceforge.net/][original documentation on sourceforge]].
